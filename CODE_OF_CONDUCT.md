# Code of Conduct

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure 
that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, 
everyone who participates in the `Turing Data Studies` project is expected to show respect and 
courtesy to other community members at all time.

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers are dedicated to making participation in our project 
a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. 

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

We also strive to adhere to the [SUM values](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/understanding-artificial-intelligence-ethics-and-safety):
- Respect the dignity of individuals.
- Connect with each other sincerely, openly, and inclusively.
- Care for the welling of all.
- Protect the priorities of social values, justice, and public interest.


## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported by contacting the project team either [David Beavan](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/david-beavan) or [Camila Rangel Smith ](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/camila-rangel-smith). All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
