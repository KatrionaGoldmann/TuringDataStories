# Turing data stories submission and review process

Our submission process consists of two stages of review. The first is a self-review by story authors upon the proposal of a new story idea. This is designed to ensure authors know what to expect when writing their story. The second is a peer review process that happens just before story publication.

## For authors: upon story proposal

Authors that want to propose a new story should open a GitHub issue under the pre-defined category "Turing Data Story Proposal". 
This issue has a template that will ask the authors to provide details about the proposed story and ask them to commit to 
follow ethical guidelines defined by the Turing Data Story project.

The author will have to fill the following fields:

### Story description 

We request the author to answer these questions:

**Please provide a high level description of the Turing Data Story**
A clear and concise description of what the data story is going to be about.

**Which datasets will you be using in this Turing Data Story?**
Cite the dataset(s) that are going to be used in this story (these of course can change whilst developing the story).

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the story here.

### Ethical guideline 

Ideally a Turing Data Story has these properties and follows the [5 safes framework](http://blog.ukdataservice.ac.uk/access-to-sensitive-data-for-research-the-5-safes/). We will request the author to commit that the story will follow this checklist:

- [ ] The analysis you produce is openly available and reproducible.
- [ ] Any data used are [open](https://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/) and have an explicit licence, provenance, and attribution.
- [ ] Any data used are not [personal data](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/what-is-personal-data/) (i.e. the data is anonymous or anonymised).
- [ ] Any linkage of datasets in your data story does not lead to an increased risk of the personal identification of individuals.
- [ ] The Story must be truthful and clear about any limitations of analysis (and potential biases in data).
- [ ] The Story will not lead to negative social outcomes, such as (but not limited to) increasing discrimination or injustice.



## For Reviewers, During Peer Review

After the story has been completed, reviewers must fill in this checklist and confirm that all the guidelines for the Turing Data Stories are followed correctly.

### Review Checklist

The checklist is the following:


#### Conflict of interest 

- [ ] I confirm that I have raised any potential COI with the handling editor
  of this submission.

#### Code of conduct
- [ ] I confirm that I read and will adhere to the Turing Data Stories [code of conduct](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/TuringDataStories/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and the SUM values therein.

#### General checks
- [ ]  **Notebook:** Is the source code for this data story available as a notebook in the linked pull request?
- [ ] **Contribution and authorship:** Are the authors clearly listed? Does the author list seem appropriate and complete?
- [ ] **Scope and eligibility:** Does the submission contain an original and complete analysis of open data? Is the story aligned with the Turing Data Stories [vision statement](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/TuringDataStories#our-vision)?


#### Reproducibility
- [ ] Does the notebook run in a local environment?
- [ ] Does the notebook build and run in binder?
- [ ] Are all data sources openly accessible and properly cited with a link?
- [ ] Are the data [open](https://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/), and do they have an explicit licence, provenance, and attribution?

#### Pedagogy
- [ ] Does the story demonstrate some specific data analysis or visualisation techniques?
- [ ] Are these techniques well motivated?
- [ ] Are these techniques well implemented?
- [ ] Is the notebook well documented, using both markdown cells and comments in code cells?
- [ ] Does the notebook have a introduction section motivating the story?
- [ ] Does the notebook have a conclusion section discussing the main insight from the stories?
- [ ] Is the paper well written (it does not require editing for structure, language, or writing quality)?

#### Context
- [ ] Does the story give an insight into some societal issue?
- [ ] Is the context around this issue well referenced (newspaper articles, scientific papers, etc.)?

#### Ethical 

- [ ] Is any linkage of datasets in story unlikely to lead to an increased risk of the personal identification of individuals?
- [ ] Is the Story truthful and clear about limitations of the analysis (and potential biases in data)?
- [ ] The Story will not lead to negative individual, societal or ecological outcomes, such as (but not limited to) increasing discrimination, injustice or providing a platform for damaging speech or views towards others. 

## Resolving Disputes

We encourage open communication between story authors and reviewers. In the case of a difference of opinion between the 
story author and a reviewer, we expect the second reviewer to mediate the discussion. If after this, the conflict is not resolved, the project will find a third neutral party to intervene.
