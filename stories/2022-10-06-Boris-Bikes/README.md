# Boris Bikes

In this story we have decided to study the dataset provided by the Transport for London Santander Bike Scheme. It is an opportunity to analyse how the scheme and its use has changed over time and how it has affected the daily lives of Londoners.

## Installation

Users wishing to run this notebook in a standalone fashion can install all required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. 

This should run without issues on Linux. We have found problems running some cells of this notebook on macOS with M1 chip.

If running this notebook directly in Binder on the Turing Data Stories page,
all required dependencies should already be present in the environment, however this notebook download and analyses a large dataset
which is larger than the default Binder memory limit.
